#Party Reservation

This is a project that I worked on in class. this project was completed by myself and other
group members. The purpose of the project was to create a program that would allow the user
to create a reservation and input the number of tables and chairs that would be needed. 
Upon completion of their reservation they would be responsible for entering a drop down list of
discounts that would help to lower the price. Follow the link to take a look at the program!
